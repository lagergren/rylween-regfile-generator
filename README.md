# rylween-regfile-generator
License file generator for my old Amiga BBS game "Adventurers of Rylween", which there apparently is still a demand for ;-)

Knock yourself out - make your copy licensed. It's on me. 

Note: I've just recreated the (very bad) hash function, written by 16 year old me by eyeballing 68xxx disassembly, so I might not have all the bugs out yet, but hopefully it should be good and write bytes in the correct byte order and stuff. Anyone with a running emulated version, or a CLI door setup or whatever you people do these days, please test it out and let me know if it worked or not.
